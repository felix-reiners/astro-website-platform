# Agent-First Development System
## Multi-Template Website Generation Platform

**Document Purpose**: Comprehensive collation of all existing information about the 12 specialized AI agents used in this platform's development methodology.

**Sources**: CLAUDE.md, README.md, docs/archive/Implementation_Tasks.md, and other project documentation.

**Status**: Historical documentation of agent system (agents lost during machine transfer)

## 🤖 Overview: Agent-First Architecture

From **Implementation_Tasks.md** (lines 83-84):

> ### **Agent Coordination Philosophy**
> Each agent has specific expertise areas but collaborates seamlessly through shared infrastructure, with clear handoff protocols and quality validation checkpoints.

The platform was designed to use 12 specialized AI agents, each with domain expertise, working together autonomously to build a production-ready multi-template website generation system.

## 💡 Lessons from Agent-First Development

From **Implementation_Tasks.md** and implementation status documents:

### What Worked
1. **Specialized expertise** - Each agent brought deep domain knowledge
2. **Clear handoff protocols** - Prevented work duplication and conflicts
3. **Quality gates** - Ensured consistent standards across all agent work
4. **Business context awareness** - Agents understood app vs consulting differences
5. **Parallel development** - Multiple agents working simultaneously on independent tasks

### Critical Dependencies
1. **Agent coordination** required careful orchestration
2. **Shared infrastructure** had to be established first by astro-architect
3. **Quality validation** needed accessibility-auditor and performance-guardian involvement
4. **Content flow** required content-generator → i18n-specialist → seo-optimizer pipeline

### Platform Architecture Benefits
- Single codebase supporting multiple business models
- Reusable components with business-aware variants
- Consistent quality standards across all generated sites
- Scalable to additional business templates in future

## 🚨 Current Status: Agents Lost in Transfer

**Issue**: The `.claude/` folder containing agent configurations was not transferred during machine migration (likely in `.gitignore`).

**Impact**:
- Agent routing documented in CLAUDE.md no longer functional
- Custom agent workflows unavailable
- Would need recreation based on this documentation

**Recovery Options**:
1. Check old MacBook for `.claude/` folder
2. Recreate agents as custom slash commands using this documentation
3. Update CLAUDE.md to reflect current available tools
