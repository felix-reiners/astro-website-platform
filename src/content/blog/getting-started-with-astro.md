# Getting Started with Astro: A Complete Guide

Astro is revolutionizing how we build websites by combining the best of static site generation with modern web development practices. In this guide, we'll explore why Astro is becoming the go-to choice for developers who prioritize performance and user experience.

## Why Choose Astro?

Astro stands out from other frameworks with its unique approach to web development:

### 1. Zero JavaScript by Default

## Getting Started

# Create a new Astro project
npm create astro@latest

npm run dev
```

## Key Features

### Content Collections

    pubDate: z.date()
  })
});
```
