2025# Implementation Checklist
## Immediate Action Items for Dual-Template Platform

### 🔧 Week 1: Development Environment Setup

#### Repository Initialization
```bash
□ Fork AstroPaper repository as foundation

□ Setup TypeScript configuration for multi-template support
```

#### Development Environment
```bash
□ Node.js 18+ with pnpm workspace support
□ VS Code with Astro extension and workspace settings
□ Configure ESLint/Prettier for monorepo structure
□ Setup GitHub Actions workflows for dual-template testing
□ Configure Vercel for multiple template deployments
```

#### Initial File Structure
```bash
astro-websites/
├── packages/
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── components/ui/        # Start with Button, Card, Hero
│   │   ├── utils/               # i18n, analytics, validation
│   │   └── config/              # Base configuration system
│   ├── templates/
│   │   ├── app-marketing/       # Begin with basic layout
│   │   └── consulting/          # Placeholder structure
│   └── generated-sites/         # Output directory
├── automation/
│   ├── generators/              # Template generation scripts
│   ├── prompts/                # Claude AI prompts (from documentation)
│   └── validators/             # Configuration validation
└── docs/                       # All documentation (completed)
```

### 🎯 Week 2: Core Component Development

#### Shared UI Components (Business-Aware)
```typescript
□ Button.astro - Context-aware variants for app vs consulting
□ Card.astro - Flexible container for both business types
□ Hero.astro - Configurable for app downloads vs consultation booking
□ ContactForm.astro - Adaptive fields based on business context
□ Navigation.astro - Dynamic menu system
```

#### Business Configuration System
```typescript
□ BusinessConfig interface supporting both templates
□ AppConfig extension for mobile app specific data
□ ConsultingConfig extension for professional services
□ Template detection and routing logic
□ Theme system with business-appropriate color schemes
```

### 🏗️ Week 3: Template Foundations

#### App Marketing Template
```bash
□ AppHomepage.astro layout
□ FeatureShowcase.astro component
□ AppDownloadButtons.astro with tracking
□ PricingTable.astro (if applicable)
□ Test with sample app configuration
```

#### Consulting Template Structure
```bash
□ ConsultingHomepage.astro layout
□ ServicesGrid.astro component placeholder
□ CaseStudyCard.astro component placeholder  
□ TeamMember.astro component placeholder
□ Plan detailed development for Phase 4
```

### 🤖 Week 4: Content Automation Foundation

#### Claude Integration Setup
```bash
□ Claude API client configuration
□ Prompt template system from Content_Automation_Prompts.md
□ Content generation workflow for app marketing
□ Content quality validation framework
□ Translation automation planning
```

#### First Automation Test
```bash
□ Generate hero content for test app
□ Create feature descriptions automatically
□ Test content quality and brand consistency
□ Document content generation workflow
```

## 🚨 Critical Success Factors

### Keep Templates Truly Shared
- Components must work for both business models without modification
- Business context should be automatic, not manual configuration
- Shared components should feel native to each business type

### Maintain Quality Standards
- Never compromise on 95+ Lighthouse scores for either template
- Accessibility testing must cover both B2C (app) and B2B (consulting) scenarios
- Content automation must produce genuinely useful content

### Document Everything
- Every architectural decision should be reflected in documentation
- Component APIs should be clearly documented for both contexts
- Update documentation as implementation reveals new insights

## 📞 Immediate Support Needs

### Team Coordination
1. **Frontend Developer**: Focus on shared component architecture
2. **DevOps Engineer**: Setup monorepo and automation foundation  
3. **Designer**: Create business-appropriate design systems
4. **Content Strategist**: Refine Claude prompts based on early testing

### Technology Decisions
- Finalize monorepo structure (Lerna, pnpm workspaces, or simple structure)
- Choose template detection mechanism (config-based vs URL-based)
- Decide on component customization approach (props vs variants)
- Plan deployment strategy for multiple templates
