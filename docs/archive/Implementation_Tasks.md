## 🚨 **RISK MANAGEMENT & CONTINGENCIES**

### **Critical Path Monitoring**
**High-Risk Dependencies**:
1. **Agent Coordination**: If agents block each other, use parallel development tracks
2. **Quality Standards**: If quality drops, implement mandatory review gates
3. **Performance Targets**: If Lighthouse scores fall, priority performance sprint
4. **Content Quality**: If AI content quality declines, implement human review loop

### **Escalation Procedures**
**Level 1**: Agent-to-agent coordination issues → Team lead mediation  
**Level 2**: Quality standard failures → Architecture review and adjustment  
**Level 3**: Timeline delays > 1 week → Scope adjustment and priority rebalancing  
**Level 4**: Platform architecture issues → External consultation and redesign

### **Contingency Plans**
